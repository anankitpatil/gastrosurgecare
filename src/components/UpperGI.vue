      <img class="inline" src="http://via.placeholder.com/600x600" />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Hiatus Hernia</b> with reflux oesophagitis happens due to weakness in a sphincter musculature. A part of the stomach along with its acid contents herniates in to the chest cavity which usually causes severe symptoms like burning and vomiting.</p>
          <p>Laparoscopic hiatus hernia repair with fundoplication is the curative treatment for this problem.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Achalasia cardia</b> is a failure of lower oesphagal sphincter to relax causing severe dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) and malnourishment. Laparoscopic Hellerâ€™s cardio myotomy is one of the golden standard procedures to correct this
            pathology.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Benign tumors</b>: The most common type of noncancerous tumor is a leiomyoma, a tumor of the smooth muscle. A small number of leiomyomas grow large enough to cause partial obstruction of the esophagus, which may lead to difficulty swallowing
            (dysphagia) and pain or discomfort. </p>
          <p>Periodic follow-up of asymptomatic or smaller lesions is recommended because leiomyomas have a characteristic radiographic appearance, slow growth rate, and low risk of malignant degeneration.</p>
          <p>Surgical excision is recommended for symptomatic and large (greater than 5 cm ) leiomyomas to confirm that a tumor is not malignant.</p>
          <p>Tumors of the middle third of the esophagus are approached using a right thoracotomy; tumors in the distal third of the esophagus are resected through a left thoracotomy.</p>
          <p>Segmental esophageal resection may be done for giant leiomyomas of the cardia.</p>
          <p>While open surgical technique is the traditional mainstay of therapy for leiomyomas, combined esophagoscopy and video-assisted resection (thoracoscopy) or laparoscopic transhiatal resection may also be performed.</p>
          <p>Endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection (ESTD) is a safe and effective treatment for esophageal leiomyoma and that it has advantages over endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).</p>
          <p>Other types of noncancerous tumors, including those consisting of connective tissue (fibrovascular polyps) and tissues related to nerves (schwannomas), are rare.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Corrosive injuries</b>: caused by ingestion of caustic acidic or alkaline substances or endoscopic damage or radiation therapy usually leads to esophageal stricture formation. Chronic strictures may require serial dilations or placement of
            Oesophagal stents to maintain the adequate lumen diameter. More severe strictures or irreversible damage may require esophagectomy or bypass with colon or small bowel interposition.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Cancers</b>: To treat early-stage cancer of the esophagus before the cancer has spread or metastasized to the stomach or other organs, an esophagectomy (removal of the esophagus or a malignant portion of the esophagus and nearby lymph nodes)
            is most often performed. Esophagectomy is also a treatment for esophageal dysplasia, also known as Barrett's esophagus, which is a precancerous condition of the cells in the lining of the esophagus. Lymph nodes are removed to be tested for
            the presence of cancer cells, which helps to determine if the cancer is spreading.</p>
          <p>An esophagogastrectomy is performed when cancer of the esophagus has been shown to be spreading to nearby lymph nodes and to the stomach, creating new tumors. The goal of esophagogastrectomy is to relieve difficult or painful swallowing (dysphagia)
            in patients with advanced esophageal cancer, and to prevent or slow the spread of metastases to more distant organs such as the liver or the brain.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Cancer of the stomach</b> requires partial or total gastrectomy along with extensive lymph node dissection. Duodenal resections are performed for malignant diseases like carcinomas and carcinoid tumours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Peptic ulcers</b>: which are not responding to medical management or complications such as gastric outlet obstruction and recurrent ulcerations are treated by laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy with vagotomy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Abdominal angina Mesenteric revascularization</b>: With the advent of modern endovascular surgery, many new techniques have emerged as possible alternatives to bypass surgery. Its less invasive nature makes endovascular surgery ideal for patients
            with multiple comorbidities, who may be at high risk for complications from open surgery. relieves the symptoms of abdominal angina. The classic operation for relieving the symptoms of abdominal angina includes removal of the obstructing lesion,
            bypass of the obstructed portion of the blood vessel, or both. Because atherosclerosis involves systemic circulation, generally all three blood vessels (celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery [SMA], and inferior mesenteric artery [IMA])
            are involved. Relieving the symptoms of abdominal angina requires revascularization of at least two of the three vessels.</p>
          <p>With the advent of modern endovascular surgery, many new techniques have emerged as possible alternatives to bypass surgery. Its less invasive nature makes endovascular surgery ideal for patients with multiple comorbidities, who may be at high
            risk for complications from open surgery.</p>
          <p>Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) thrombectomy is a useful treatment for this condition.Spleen ruptures Spleenectomy for infective haemotological or post traumatic spleen ruptures, laparoscopic spleenectomy for haematoilocail disorders like ITP,
